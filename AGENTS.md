# Algebra Worksheet Guidelines

- Keep worksheets at 12 problems unless otherwise specified, with an instructions section to state timing and answer expectations.
- Focus on challenging Algebra II topics: rational root theorem, factoring (including quartics), polynomial long division/synthetic division, complex roots and conjugate pairs, complex arithmetic, vertex/maximum-minimum analysis of quadratics, and applied revenue/price optimization word problems.
- Avoid giving hints or descriptive labels in the problem statements; present problems concisely.
- Allow multi-part problems when useful for depth (e.g., list possible roots, find one, factor fully).
- Use exact forms over decimals; specify when exact form is expected.
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing LaTeX sheets under `algebra/src`, and build PDFs to `algebra/build`.

# Arithmetic Worksheet Guidelines

- Use clear instructions about answer format (e.g., improper fractions) and time expectations.
- Cover core fraction skills: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and mixed numbers; include occasional challenge problems that combine operations.
- Keep layout simple with grouped sections for each operation and total problem count aligned with the current arithmetic templates.
- Maintain consistent LaTeX formatting with existing sheets under `arithmetic/src`, building PDFs to `arithmetic/build`.
